This project is focused on building an AI Agent that plays Minesweeper using **propositional logic** and **inference**.

---

The goal is to build a reasoning engine that:
- Represents knowledge about the game board
- Marks cells as safe or mines
- Makes inferences based on known constraints
- Plays the game autonomously using logic

---

Stay tuned for updates as the AI evolves!
